	abstract = {Motivation: Recent advances in high-throughput omics technologies have enabled biomedical researchers to collect large-scale genomic data. As a consequence, there has been growing interest in developing methods to integrate such data to obtain deeper insights regarding the underlying biological system. A key challenge for integrative studies is the heterogeneity present in the different omics data sources, which makes it difficult to discern the coordinated signal of interest from source-specific noise or extraneous effects.},

	abstract = {Canonical correlation analysis investigates linear relationships between two sets of variables, but often works poorly on modern datasets due to high-dimensionality and mixed data types (continuous/binary/zero-inflated). We propose a new approach for sparse canonical correlation analysis of mixed data types that does not require explicit parametric assumptions. Our main contribution is the use of truncated latent Gaussian copula to model the data with excess zeroes, which allows us to derive a rank-based estimator of latent correlation matrix without the estimation of marginal transformation functions. The resulting semiparametric sparse canonical correlation analysis method works well in high-dimensional settings as demonstrated via numerical studies, and application to the analysis of association between gene expression and micro RNA data of breast cancer patients.},

	abstract = {We consider the situation of estimating the parameters in a generalized linear prediction model, from an internal dataset, where the outcome variable Y is binary and there are two sets of covariates, X and Z. We have information from an external study that provides parameter estimates for a generalized linear model of Y on X . We propose a method that makes limited assumptions about the similarity of the distributions in the two study populations. The method involves orthogonalizing the Z variables and then borrowing information about the ratio of the coefficients from the external model. The method is justified based on a new result relating the parameters in a generalized linear model to the parameters in a generalized linear model with omitted covariates. The method is applicable if the regression coefficients in the Y given X model are similar in the two populations, up to an unknown scalar constant. This type of transportability between populations is something that can be checked from the available data. The asymptotic variance of the proposed method is derived. The method is evaluated in a simulation study and shown to gain efficiency compared to simple analysis of the internal dataset, and is robust compared to an alternative method of incorporating external information.},
